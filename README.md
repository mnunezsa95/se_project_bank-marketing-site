### Intro - About the project

The Bank Marketing Website serves as the frontend platform designed to encourage the utilization of the My-Banking Application. Constructed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this website amalgamates both traditional and contemporary web development techniques to deliver a modern and engaging user experience. The incorporation of these techniques reflects a commitment to providing users with an intuitive and up-to-date interface.

### Description of the Project

The website incorporates several traditional features like the ability to open and close modals using buttons as well as the escape key.

Additionally, the website boasts a range of modern functionalities implemented entirely with vanilla JavaScript. These advanced features encompass lazy loading of images, responsive handling of hovers, a sticky navigation bar, implementation of the intersection observer for dynamic content loading, and a smooth image slider, among various others. These elements contribute to a contemporary and user-friendly web experience.
